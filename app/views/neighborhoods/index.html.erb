<h1>~ Neighborhood Swap and Share ~</h1>
<h3>Find kids' goods in your neighborhood!</h3>

<p>Raising kids is a life-changing adventure. It twists and turns with joy and sorrow, laughter and tears. Its a rewarding and valuable experience. But let's face it, raising kids is also expensive.</p>

<p>Halloween just passed and your little Darth Vader won't be able to wear the same costume next year because he will have outgrown it - not that he would want to anyway! Your neighbor would love to have that costume for his little one and would be willing to exchange something for it - maybe a pair of walkie-talkies. How would you find out about each other? On this website!</p>

<h4>As a "seller," you can post an item to swap for something else, share your item with another user, or gift it if you so choose.</h4>
